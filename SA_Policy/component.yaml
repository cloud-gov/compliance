      Agency System Maintenance Policy Implementation

      System Maintenance Policy is included in CIO P 2100.1 - GSA IT Security Policy, Chapter 4. Policy on Operational Controls. It states, "The availability and usability of GSA equipment and software must be maintained and safeguarded to enable agency objectives to be accomplished."

      GSA OCISO ISP also defined agency-wide system maintenance procedures in IT Security Procedural Guide: Maintenance (CIO-IT Security-10-50).

      18F follows the GSA System Maintenance policy for its information systems hosted within GSA facilities. The cloud.gov information system is hosted with the AWS GovCloud and will be in purview of the hosting site’s Maintenance policy and procedures.

      The 18F DevOps team practices the Scrumban process when developing new features or fixing existing issues - including security fixes and enhancements, for cloud.gov.  Each feature / issue is assigned to a card in the system where it goes thru a process of being identified, prioritized, explored, delivered, and finally demonstrated. Each card is reviewed by the team as a whole throughout its lifecycle to identify any security risks or concerns - these are recorded on the card as acceptance criteria when development is complete.

      Once development is complete, the code submitted to our version control system as a “pull request" where it is further reviewed before being merged into the code base.  New features will then be deployed into our staging area where they will be undergo further security review / stakeholder acceptance, as well as automated acceptance tests.

      The cloud.gov team is broken into several sub-teams with differing areas of responsibility and expertise.   Security is a foremost concern for members of all teams.  The cloud.gov Atlas sub-team is primarily focused on implementing security policies at the platform level.
  - key: c
    text: |
      Each member of the DevOps team has the necessary security background to properly handle sensitive data, such as security keys and certificates, and to evaluate the security implications associated with configuration changes.  Access to cloud.gov and its components is controlled thru various means, including AWS security groups, Cloud Foundry roles, and GitHub team membership.

      The cloud.gov Atlas team continually monitors the configurations of the various components of cloud.gov to ensure they meet the requirements for protecting sensitive data.

      18F will replace information system components when support for the components is no longer available from the developer, vendor, or manufacturer; and will provide justification and documents approval for the continued use of unsupported system components required to satisfy mission/business needs.

      Cloud Foundry Platform as a Service system replacement:

      A system & software inventory is run nightly, and the DevOps team reviews the inventory weekly to ensure that all software inventoried is accurate and currently supported. This process includes:

      * Verify that the software license support expiration date is not within six months. 18F uses the open source version of Cloud Foundry which uses the open source Apache 2.0 license.
      * Ensure that the software version is still supported.
      * Refer to the vendor's support website to verify that support does not have an \u201CEnd of Life\u201D date of less than six months.

      Since 18F is using the open source version of Cloud Foundry, an additional task will be issued to upgrade Cloud Foundry suite to the latest versions. DevOps will review the GitHub cloudfoundry/cf-release repository for implementation of the updated version.
