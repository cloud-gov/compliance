    The Cloud Foundry platform as a service does NOT create, store or process any
    personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive information as identified
    by parameter requirement 1.


    Applications running on Cloud Foundry receive requests through the URLs configured
    for the application. HTTP requests arrive on ports 80 and 443. Additionally, Cloud
    Foundry requires a channel for TCP/WebSocket traffic. The default cf-release manifest
    assigns port: 4443 for TCP/WebSocket communications.

    All traffic from the public internet to the Cloud Controller and UAA happens over
    HTTPS. Inside the boundary of the system, components communicate over a publish-subscribe
    (pub-sub) port: 4222 message bus, NATs


    For stored data identified by parameter 2, the following cryptographic mechanisms
    are used to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of stored data.

    Operators configure encryption of the identity store in the UAA. When users register
    an account with the Cloud Foundry platform, the UAA, acts as the user store and
    stores user passwords in the UAA database using bcrypt. Bcrypt is a blowfish encryption
    algorithm, which enables cloud foundry to store a secure hash of your users''
    passwords.

    The Cloud Controller stores the configuration for an application in an encrypted
    database table. This configuration data includes user-specified environment variables
    and service credentials for any services bound to the app.

    Application developers push their code using the Cloud Foundry API. Cloud Foundry
    secures each call to the CF API using the UAA and SSL

    To combat spoofing Cloud Foundry network traffic rules help prevents the attack
    from accessing application containers. Cloud Foundry uses application isolation,
    operating system restrictions, and encrypted connections to further mitigate risk.
