      narrative: '18F has created specific Cloud.Gov security groups associated with
        VPCs to provide full control over inbound and outbound traffic. 18F has created
        a specific set of VPCs (Live production and staging) for its Cloud.Gov implementation.  All
        VPCs have subnets used to separate and control IP address space within each
        individual VPC.  Subnets must be created in order to launch Availability Zone
        (AZ) specific services within a VPC. 18F has setup VPC Peering between the
        Staging VPC and the CF Live production VPC.

      narrative: 'Cloud.Gov enforces security groups and other network traffic rules
        in a strict priority order. Cloud.Gov returns an allow, deny, or reject result
        for the first rule that matches the outbound traffic request parameters, and
        does not evaluate any lower-priority rules

        Cloud.Gov implements network traffic rules using Linux iptables on the component
        VMs. DevOps configures rules to prevent system access from external networks
        and between internal components, and to restrict applications from establishing
        connections over the DEA network interface. Cloud.Gov application security
        groups (ASG) consists of a list of access rules to control application outbound
        traffic.

        DEA Network Properties allow DevOps to configure the allow_networks and deny_networks
        parameters for DEAs to prohibit communication between system components and
        applications.
