  narrative:
    a: '18F Conducts monthly Operating System (OS) and web application scanning; quarterly
      database scanning; and, OS and Web application scanning with every code release.
      18F conducts internal vulnerabilty scanning of its VPC and private subnets within
      the 18F Virtual Private Cloud.

      '
    b: '18F vulnerabilty scanning toos utilize techniques that promote interoperability

      (CPE), and Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE) and OWASP TOP 10 vulnerabilities.

      '

      assessments at least weekly and appropriate actions taken on discovery of vulnerabilities
      within the 18F Cloud Infrastructure and applications and from security control
      assessments conducted on its information systems.

      '
    d: 'High-risk vulnerabilities are mitigated within thirty days (30); moderate
      risk vulnerabilities mitigated within ninety days (90). If the recommended steps
      will adversely impact functionality or performance, the ISSO/ISSM will reviews
      changes and mitigating controls with 18F DevOps as well as the Cloud Foundry
      system owners.

      '
    e: '18F shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and
      security control assessments with designated System Owners, DevOPs, GSA SecOps,
      ISSM and the Authorizing Official (AO) to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities
      in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or deficiencies).
