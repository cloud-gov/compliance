  narrative:
    a: "The 18F DevOps and SecOps teams monitors the Cloud.Gov information system\
      \ to detect potential attacks and intrusions from internal and external sources\
      \ in accordance with the 18F System Information and Integrity Policy section\
      \ 3 - Information System monitoring, the FedRAMP Incident communication procedures\
      \ and GSA CIO-IT Security-08-39 section \u201CSystem Monitoring / Audit Record\
      \ Review \u201C for GSA specifc infomation systems\n"
    b: '18F identifies un-authorized access to the Cloud.Gov information system using   automated
      monitoring tools within its virutal proviate cloud for monitoringing, log management
      and event analysis. 18F monitors for attacks and indicators of potential attacks,  unauthorized
      local, network, and remote connections.

      '
    c: 'The infrastructure that hosts Cloud.Gov provides monitoring and intrusion
      detcetion of unsual activity at  the phyical and network layers. 18F is responsible
      for monitoring everything related to its virtual infrastructure and has deployed
      monitoring  and intrusion dectction tools within its virtual private cloud to
      log and dectect malicious activities to its information systems including Cloud.Gov.

      '
    d: '18F ensures intrusion and monitoring tools are protected  from unauthorized
      access by only granting access to certian members from the DevOps and SecOps
      team. All monitoring and intrusion information data is protected by limiting
      accounts to authorized privileged users only and is maintained in secured repositories
      for review by those members.

      '
    e: 'Information system monitoring will be heightened based on advisories from
      Pivitol, US-CERT Advisories, commercial security communities, and other sources.

      '
    f: 'Information system monitoring will be conducted in accordance and compliance
      with 18F security policies and all applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives,
      and regulations.

      '
    g: '18F provides monitoring of all information system components in the event
      of an event or incident, information will be provided as it is available.  Scheduled
      reports will be provided for events such as after-hours administrative logins,
      users being added to privileged groups, persistent malware detections, etc.
      to designated members of the DevOps teams and SecOps teams as needed

      Cloud Foundry manages software vulnerability using releases and BOSH stemcells.
      New Cloud Foundry releases are created with updates to address code issues,
      while new stemcells are created with patches for the latest security fixes to
      address any underlying operating system issues. New Cloud Foundry releases are
      located at https://github.com/Cloud Foundry/cf-release.

      18F implemenets the release of Cloud Foundy he what (or the software developer/vendor
      in the case of software developed and maintained by a vendor/contractor) promptly
      installs newly released security relevant patches and tests patches, for effectiveness
      and potential side effects on information systems before installation.
