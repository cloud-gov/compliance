    Identifier Management

    18F manages information system identifiers for users and devices by:

    * Receiving authorization from a designated organizational official to assign
    a user or device identifier.

    * Selecting an identifier that uniquely identifies an individual or device.

    * Assigning the user identifier to the intended party or the device identifier
    to the intended device.

    * Preventing reuse of user or device identifiers for one (1).

    * Disabling the user identifier after ninety (90) days of inactivity for general
    user accounts and thirty (30) days for administrator level accounts.
