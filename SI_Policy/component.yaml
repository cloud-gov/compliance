      The 18F DevOps and SecOps teams monitors the Cloud.Gov information
      system to detect potential attacks and intrusions from internal and external
      sources in accordance with the 18F System Information and Integrity Policy section

      18F identifies un-authorized access to the Cloud.Gov information system using automated monitoring
      tools within its virutal proviate cloud for monitoringing, log management and

      The infrastructure
      that hosts Cloud.Gov provides monitoring and intrusion detcetion of unsual activity
      at the phyical and network layers. 18F is responsible for monitoring everything
      related to its virtual infrastructure and has deployed monitoring  and intrusion
      dectction tools within its virtual private cloud to log and dectect malicious
      activities to its information systems including Cloud.Gov.

      18F ensures intrusion and monitoring tools are protected  from unauthorized access
      by only granting access to certian members from the DevOps and SecOps team.
      All monitoring and intrusion information data is protected by limiting accounts
      to authorized privileged users only and is maintained in secured repositories
      for review by those members.

      Cloud Foundry
      manages software vulnerability using releases and BOSH stemcells. New Cloud
      Foundry releases are created with updates to address code issues, while new
      stemcells are created with patches for the latest security fixes to address
      any underlying operating system issues. New Cloud Foundry releases are located
      at https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release.
      18F implements the release
      of Cloud Foundry he what (or the software developer/vendor in the case of software
      developed and maintained by a vendor/contractor) promptly installs newly released
      security relevant patches and tests patches, for effectiveness and potential
      side effects on information systems before installation.
