# cloud.gov Compliance

Compliance documentation and automation.

## Historical / OpenControl note

This repository was originally intended to document cloud.gov's SSP using 
[Compliance Masonry](https://github.com/opencontrol/compliance-masonry), but by 2020 that effort had been dormant for 4 years, and is now archived [here in the `opencontrol` tag](https://github.com/cloud-gov/cg-compliance/tree/opencontrol). We aim to revive that effort using [NIST's OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/)


## Audit

See the [Audit directory README](./README.md) for guidance on running
automated audits.
